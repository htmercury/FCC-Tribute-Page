      <p class="text-white px-5 text-justify">Club Penguin was an online-based, massively multiplayer online role-playing game (abbreviated as a MMORPG) created by Disney Canada Inc. (previously New Horizons Interactive) in the summer of 2005. It involved a virtual world, where the players were penguins, and was featuring a large range of minigames and other online activities, and was based on a snowy island, after which the game was named.</p>
